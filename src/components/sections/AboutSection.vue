      About Me
    </h1>
    <section>
      Along side a huge passion to developing state-of-the-art software solutions, I always had a product oriented way
      of looking at software.
      I find the psychological elements of UI/UX and how they make a product desirable fascinating.
      I believe that the UX of a product is not less important than the functionality.
      This perspective led my main focus to be on frontend, ensuring application components are modular consistent,
      robust and flexible.
