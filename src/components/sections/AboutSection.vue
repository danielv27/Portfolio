        About Me
      </h1>
      <section>
        Alongside a huge passion for developing state-of-the-art software solutions, I always had a product-oriented way
        of looking at software.
        I find the psychological elements of UI/UX and how they make a product desirable fascinating.
        I believe that the UX of a product is not less important than the functionality.
        This perspective led my main focus to be on the frontend, ensuring application components are modular, consistent,
        robust, and flexible.
